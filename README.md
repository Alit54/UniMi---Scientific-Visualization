# Scientific Visualization Project

Code for plot generation about state-of-the-art machine learning (artificial intelligence).

Eight areas of interest were chosen, these are: economy, education, policy and governance,
public opinion, research and development, responsible AI, science and medicine and technical performance.

For each area of interest, the most important aspects were analyzed.
